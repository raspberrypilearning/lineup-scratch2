## Challenge: improve your game
Here are some ideas for how to make your game more interesting:

- Can you alter your scripts so that you can use even more costumes?
- How about choosing a background and then making the sprites nearer the top of the screen appear smaller, so they seem further away?
- Can you make the game run for several rounds and provide you with a score based on how long it takes you to complete five rounds?
