## What next?

- Try the [Flappy parrot](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/flappy-parrot) project, in which you create another game.

- If you want, you can also use a project in which you make a game with the Sense HAT emulator, for example [Tightrope](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/tightrope).
