## Test the script

--- task ---
To test the script, you need to **call** the custom block and provide it with the number of `columns`{:class="blockmoreblocks"} you want in your grid.

Add this code to your sprite:

![blocks_1546524619_8263285](images/blocks_1546524619_8263285.png)
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Now click on the green flag to run your code. You should see your two lists fill with values.

![lists](images/filled_lists.png)
	
If your results don't look like this, then go back to the previous step, have a look at the hints, and try to fix your script.
